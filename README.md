# file-merge-plus

**Goal:** Merge `part1.txt` and `part2.txt` and count **non-empty** lines.

**Run**
```bash
python main.py
```
Slight hint:

Different split functions behave differently with trailing newlines (split("\n") vs splitlines()). Use a method that avoids counting blank trailing lines.

Deliverable:

Program prints Merged 5 non-empty lines.

### `file-merge-plus/part1.txt`
line one

line two

line three



### `file-merge-plus/part2.txt`
line four

line five
